the telegram bot gives us the ability to keep this running on my home server but be served by telegrams network.

so docker should setup a service that hosts the telegram agent channel and the agent itself along with this system handling each request locally but be setup for development and production 

development is on mac os and needs simple localhost etc. 
production is running on a PC as a server this windows machine needs to be able to easily be configured with the deployment plan so that the system will answer the agent no matter where I send the text through with telegram.

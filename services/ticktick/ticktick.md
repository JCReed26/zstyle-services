# TickTick

ticktick is meant to be the central point for tasks, events, calendar, reminder, etc
for its vast ecosystem of ways to be reminded regular/constant/alarm, event/task duration, low cost, long descriptions, sub-tasks, connected tasks, multiple lists, etc.
this will allow detail to be given and simplified versions that fit other platforms to utilize every ecosystem in your life without having to handle 100 different todolists

this is the dream for the ticktick service to also be where life refactoring takes place and more so this needs to operate like a reliable truck

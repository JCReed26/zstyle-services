openmemory + reminder service

apps like memorae are just queues to remember and remind users of certain things they needed to remember specific details they need to recall etc. 
which these are just memory chatbots. 
we mix openmemory with ticktick to life integration but also personalization of main agent in our system that differs as an executive function coach for users. 

this services shall act as a brain to remember things that need to be done 
this service shall be able to send reminders without the interaction of a human when the reminder is ready
this service will use openmemory, ticktick, and reminder service log for users to determine extra needed context not directly given by the user

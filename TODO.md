# TODO

always best to follow and in order

* [ ] 1. Create Simple Telegram Bot Wrapper and Test 
* [ ] 2. Setup docker-compose with ngrok if need to for local
* [ ] 3. Establish the database, bucket storage, etc to allow more to be added over time
* [ ] 4. Ensure we can spin it up and down with new changes to database (like new integration token, new agent that needs a storage point for its users json, etc.)
* [ ] 5. Telegram buttons for form approval send and receive back 
* [ ] 6. Telegram can send agent and image/screenshot and the agent can analyze the data on the image (could also send nano-banana images and links to online memes it finds)

* [ ] 7. Chaos test -> send multiple messages, check thinking, google_search prod requirements?, security checks, CODE RABBIT & VantaAI & docs.adk.
